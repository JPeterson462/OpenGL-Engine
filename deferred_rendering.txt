	Scene Rendering
	
A GBuffer includes:
	- Depth
	- Diffuse
	- Normals
	- Material (Reflectivity, Shine Damper)	

Refraction is below the water plane, reflection is above
	
1. Render the refraction scene to a GBuffer

2. Render the reflection scene to a GBuffer

3. Render the water tiles to a GBuffer
	- Bind the refraction and reflection GBuffers

4. Render the shadows and lights to a texture
	- Bind the refraction, reflection, and water GBuffers
	
5. Apply post processing to the texture

	while (PostProcessing)
		texture = PostProcess(texture)
		
6. Render the final texture to the default framebuffer

* where to add fog?
* converting light vectors to tangent space?
* skybox rendering last
- fix skybox texture
