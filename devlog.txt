- Fix particle rendering
- Shadows to other entities
- Soft shadows (Shadows distorted depending on rotation towards shadow)
- Music on its own thread?
- Label Widget not rendering
- Fix PostProcessingRenderer (doesn't render to FBO, just straight to screen)

- Lighting animated models
- Optimize animated models
- Normal Mapped animated models
- Clean up access to Assets.getEngine()
- Reflecting animated models (clip planes)

Terrain:
- navmesh for traveling on terrain
- note: could use other color values to allow more types of terrain in blendmap

Models:
- add material loading to OBJ importer

Graphics:
- hiding cursor (locking mouse to window)
- changing cursor
- normal mapped shader doesn't fade with fog
- optimize shader uploads and other calls

Physics:
- fix or rewrite
- fix WA or SD combined movement
- find a better physics data structure (QuadTree?)
- change orientation during collision
- connect engine.physics.Body to engine.Entity

Text:
- text renderer with multiple pages
- text alignment

Skybox:
- follow ThinMatrix tutorial again?
- skybox background color
- cloud layers on skybox
- stars at night
- better fog
- skybox rotate with player
- doppler effect-ish
- update fog color from skybox

Water:
- fix soft edges (Water Tutorial 8)

Other:
- mouse picker usage: improved first person camera controls?
- fix first person camera controller rotation and movement
