- Lock mouse to center of screen and handle movement left or right before recentering

- Normal mapped terrain
- Lighting water
- Fix particle rendering (check computed view matrix)
- Shadows to other entities
- Soft shadows
- Music on its own thread?
- Fix PostProcessingRenderer (doesn't render to FBO, just straight to screen)
- shader imports

- Remove awful text renderer workaround to glBufferSubData
- rendering to framebuffer for expensive renders like fonts?
- deferred lighting?
- Networking

Terrain:
- navmesh for traveling on terrain
- note: could use other color values to allow more types of terrain in blendmap

Models:
- add material loading to OBJ importer

Graphics:
- hiding cursor (locking mouse to window)
- changing cursor
- normal mapped shader doesn't fade with fog
- optimize shader uploads and other calls

Physics:
- fix or rewrite
- fix WA or SD combined movement
- find a better physics data structure (QuadTree?)
- change orientation during collision
- connect engine.physics.Body to engine.Entity

Skybox:
- more realistic
- better fog
- doppler effect-ish
- top texture not valids
- RGB skybox
- update sky color

Water:
- fix soft edges (Water Tutorial 8)

Other:
- mouse picker usage: improved first person camera controls?
- fix first person camera controller rotation and movement
